AI turns data into decisions by learning patterns from examples instead of following only hand-written rules.
It powers things like medical-image analysis, voice assistants, fraud detection, and smart recommendations.
Modern AI is largely built on machine learning, especially deep neural networks trained on lots of data.
Used well, it boosts accuracy and speed, but it must be designed carefully to reduce bias, errors, and privacy risks.
