Origins
Medieval Arabic historians give contradictory data about Ṭāriq's origins and ethnicity. Some conclusions about his personality and the circumstances of his entry into al-Andalus are surrounded by uncertainty.[1] The vast majority of modern sources state that Ṭāriq was a Berber mawla of Musa ibn Nusayr, the Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya.[1][2][3][4]

According to Ibn Khaldun, Tariq Ibn Ziyad was from a Berber tribe in what is now Algeria.[5] Heinrich Barth mentions that Tariq Ibn Ziyad was a Berber from the tribe of the Ulhassa,[6] a tribe native to the Tafna[7] that currently inhabits the Béni Saf region in Algeria.[8] According to David Nicolle, Tariq Ibn Ziyad is first mentioned in historical records as the governor of Tangier.[5] Additionally, as per David Nicolle, it is traditionally believed that he was born in Wadi Tafna (a region in present day Tlemcen).[5][9] He had also lived there with his wife prior to his governance of Tangier.[10]
